# food sins

 a final project for a computer science course that attempts to combine elements from JRPGs, tower defense games, and bullet hell survival in the context of a cute goose trying to save his family's business - restaurants. 

## story
our hero - goose - is faced with the responsbility of saving the family business. the quacksay family owns multiple restaurants around the world, from italy, japan, china, colombia, the philippines, and the united states. he must take over and manage each restaurant by fulfilling orders and filling in as the executive chef. can goose save the restaurant and save his family from going bankrupt?! (? idk might revamp story later)

## game mechanics
so... we've taken inspiration from these types of games:
- tower defense
- bullet hell survival
- turn based, anime-esque jrpg

## tower defense and bullet survival
the main dish, (say, in terms of italy, the pizza) acts as the defending tower in the first game stage. goose needs to defend both the pizza and himself from hostile toppings and complete orders to satisfy his customers.

game progression
- depends on the "order" of the customer
- need to collect key items... ingredients... in order to progress and complete the first stage

turrets
- will flesh out later

enemies
- ingredients act as the enemies. there would be two types:
  - ingredients that attack goose; after meeting a threshold, will drop their respective ingredients as a key item to add to the dish
  - ingredients that attack the tower; ingredients you don't want and would be considered food sins - don't let them ruin goose's dish, or he'll be left with unhappy customers!

items
- power ups; random items that'll give you buffs
- coins!

### currency
- enemies drop coin
- coins are rewarded based on performance at the end of a restaurant takeover
- coins can be used to purchase
- equipment upgrades
- cute clothing
  
## turn-based boss battle
 - once the 30 minute mark hits a theme starts playing and the boss comes from the of the sceeen to the bottom
 - the  a pokemon esque transition plays
 - in the boss fight your strongest towers will be summoned in your aid only maximum of 4 in total including the player
 - if you fail the fight the boss will eat your finished pizza
