 a final project for a computer science course that attempts to combine elements from JRPGs, and bullet hell survival in the context of a cute goose trying to save his family's business - restaurants. 

## story
world renowned restaurant chain goose house is in peril when their rival restaurant, foie gras pour la vie,

our hero - goose - is faced with the responsbility of saving the family business. the quacksay family owns multiple restaurants around the world, from italy, japan, china, colombia, the philippines, the united states, and so on. he must take over and manage each restaurant by fulfilling orders and filling in as the executive chef. can goose save the restaurant and save his family from going bankrupt?!

## game mechanics
so... we've taken inspiration from these types of games:
- bullet hell survival


## bullet survival
. goose needs to defend both the pizza and himself from hostile toppings and complete orders to satisfy his customers.

game progression
- depends on the "order" of the customer
- need to collect key items... ingredients... in order to progress and complete the first stage

turrets
- will flesh out later

enemies
- ingredients act as the enemies. there would be two types:
  - ingredients that attack goose; after meeting a threshold, will drop their respective ingredients as a key item to add to the dish
  - ingredients that attack the tower; ingredients you don't want and would be considered food sins - don't let them ruin goose's dish, or he'll be left with unhappy customers!

items
- power ups; random items that'll give you buffs
